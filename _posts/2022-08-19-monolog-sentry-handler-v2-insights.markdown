Some weeks ago, I released a [new version of Monolog Sentry handler](https://twitter.com/B_Galati/status/1553016326834343943)
and I thought it would be a good idea to share some insights about it; so here we are üòÉ.

The main goal of this release was to support the new major version (v3) of PHP Sentry SDK.
Details about it are in the [release note](https://github.com/B-Galati/monolog-sentry-handler/releases/tag/2.0.0)
which contains pointers to the upgrade guide and more.

As a reminder this library is a Monolog Sentry Handler that displays Monolog logs as Sentry breadcrumbs.
So with the right Monolog config you can end up with the screenshot below; it's practical
for debugging purpose to have all logs related to an error in your error tracking tool üëç.

Migrating the code to work with the new Sentry SDK was quick, the most time-consuming tasks were:
- Testing manually SDK changes: ensuring the lib still works correctly basically
- Adding compatibility with the new version of Monolog (v3)
- Updating the doc to be compatible with the new version of the library and Symfony
- Migrating to GitHub actions: that was the 1st time for me

If you want to quickly try the library, you can use
the new [example repository](https://github.com/B-Galati/monolog-sentry-handler-example).

Note that the library can be used with the [official Symfony bundle](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-symfony).
It is a bit easier to set up with the bundle, and it comes with more features by default.

Thanks again to [Grzegorz Korba](https://twitter.com/_Codito_) who initiated that work!
